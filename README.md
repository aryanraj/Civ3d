# Structural Analysis Package for Civil Engineering Structures

The package contains a solver which could be used to perform analysis to solve structural analysis problems and be easily integrated with workflows of an organisation working on analysis and design of civil engineering structures.

## Aim of the project
The aim of the project is not just to be a replacement of commercially available softwares. Many organisations have a workflows where they make use of a commercial software for the analysis and then use home grown workflows involving spreadsheets to perform design. These commertial softwares are good for analysis and to some extent design as a standalone application. However, their binding interfaces with external softwares is unusable if not nonexistent. Due to their closed source nature, the end user is left at the mercy of the developers to get a feature integrated in the software.

## Examples
Currently there are two examples in the `Examples/` folder which shows different work cases for this project.

> **_NOTE:_** This README is incomplete, requires a wiki page to go into in depth information about the analysis modules.
